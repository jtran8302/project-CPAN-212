// utility for reading and writing json files
// this is how we store data before we set up mongodb in phase 2
// each json file acts like a database collection
//
// will have functions like readJson(path) and writeJson(path, data)
// services/repositories will use these to load and save data
//
// after we switch to mongodb, this file probably wont be needed anymore
